    <!-- COVID-19 SECTION -->
      <h2>COVID-19</h2>      
      <div class="tan-box">
        <p>Studies have shown that Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people have a higher rate of contracting and dying from COVID-19 compared to White people. There are multiple reasons why this is the case.</p>
          <ul class="facts-ul">
            <li>Racism: COVID-19 was first found in China. Lots of racist people around the world blame Chinese people along with Koreans and Asians. This had caused people to terrorize against them by means of violence, verbal assault, or by coughing and spitting on them.</li>
            <li>Access to Healthcare: People (a part of the ethnic minority) are less likely to get paid when missing work or do not have health insurance. This means that if they contract COVID-19, they may not be able to go to the hospital and have a higher risk of dying.</li>
            <li>Location: Some places around the world make it nearly impossible to avoid COVID-19. When you add onto the coughing and spitting on them as a way of being racist, this makes a clear gateway or COVID-19.</li>
            <li>Other Diseases: Black, Hispanic, and Asian American people have a higher chance of developing type 2 diabetes. Having diabetes increases the chance of getting COVID-19.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>When you add all of this up together, it creates a big difference between how likely Ethnic people and White people are to contract COVID-19.</p>

    <!-- MATERNAL MORTALITY -->
      <h2>MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES FOR BLACK WOMEN</h2>
      <div class="tan-box">
        <p>The maternal morality rate is a big problem for women and their babies. The maternal morality rate for women is 17 deaths per 100,000 live births, but for black women it is 43 deaths per 100,000 live births. A stark and tragic difference. A big reason why the maternal morality rate is so high in black women is because of racial profiling and improper healthcare.</p>
