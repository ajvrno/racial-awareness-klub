      <h2>EDUCATION INEQUALITY</h2>      
      <div class="tan-box">
        <p>Inequal access to education among racial groups is not something new to us. As late as the 1960s, we've heard of schools segregated by race, with these schools being funded much lower than white-serving schools. While school segregation has long been outlawed thanks to Brown v. Board, unequal opportunities and access to education still remain. According to the NCES in 2015, around 60-75% of AAPI K-12 students felt that they were going to a school where less than 25% of students were there own ethnicity. Furthermore, predominantly-minority schools often have a larger student body size, curriculum and learning materials are lower in quality, and teachers are less qualified in the fields they teach.</p>

      <h2>BOOK BANS</h2>
      <div class="tan-box">
				<p>In the past years, there has been a rise in classroom book censorship in the US. However, unlike in the past where books were banned primarily for explicit language, sexual depiction, and/or violation of Christian beliefs, the current book bans are grounded on intensely polarized conservative views. Here are a couple books that have either been banned or been threatened in the past years:</p>
        <ul class="facts-ul">
          <li><cite>The Hate U Give</cite>: This book has been on the list of Top 10 Most Challenged Books almost every year since its release. Initially banned for its vulgar language and depiction of violence, this book has been further criticized and banned for its discussion of racism and discrimination in the police force â€” labeled as an "indoctrination of distruct of police."</li>
          <li><cite>The 1619 Project</cite>: This long-form journalist endeavour that aims to "reframe the country's history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contribution of black Americans at the very center of our national narrative" has been consistently threatened by Republican legislators as they assume it cynically depicts the founding fathers and Abraham Lincoln.</li>
