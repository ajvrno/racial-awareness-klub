      <h2>HISTORY OF IMMIGRATION POLICIES</h2>      
      <div class="tan-box">
        <p>Studies have shown that immigration policies are designed to keep African, Central/South American, Middle Eastern and Asian immigrants out of the US compared to their European counterparts. These are some of the policies: </p>
          <ul class="facts-ul">
						<li>From the establishment of the US in 1790, there was a law stating that only “free white persons” were allowed to take part in naturalization. </li>
						<li>In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act was established to ban Chinese from partaking in labor and naturalization in the US (which lasted over ten years). </li>
						<li>The Immigration Acts of 1924 was supposedly a qouta that only allowed two percent of the total population from each nationality. This specifically favored European immigrants and ignored BIPOC.</li>						
          </ul>

      <h2>UNDOCUMENTATION + DEPORTATION</h2>
      <div class="tan-box">
				<p>Now in the US, there are about 11.5 million undocumented immigrants that are seeking citizenship policies, over 50% being Latinos. Even though they comply with paying local and state taxes, they are still refused to provide them with Social Security and medical care. Some of the policies that play into this are: </p>
				<ul class="facts-ul">
					<li>In the 1990s and early 2000s, there was a heavy increase in militarization at the Mexico-US border from the Clinton administarion. </li>
					<li>In 1996, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) said that undocumented immigrants could be deported without much judicial care in cases as well as quickening many deportations.</li>
					<li>In recent years, the idea of  “attrition through enforcement” basically arrests undocumented immigrants and places them into detention centers or even jails for a prolonged period. </li>
