          <p class="raceq-par">Racial equality is a situation in which <em>people of all races are treated in the same way.</em> In other words, regardless of physical traits such as skin color, racial equality occurs when institutions give individuals legal, moral, and political rights.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tan-box">
          <h2 class="raceq-head">WHY DOES IT MATTER?</h2>
          <p class="raceq-par">Racial justice and equality goes beyond simply dispelling racial discrimination and disparities through kinder words or actions. It is also about <em>increasing the amount of supports and policies in our system</em> that are aimed at achieving and sustaining racial justice and equality. By being informed, you can be part of the path to ensuring racial equality is in place.</p>
